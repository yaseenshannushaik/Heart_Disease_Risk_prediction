# üíì Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using supervised machine learning models. The project leverages clinical data such as cholesterol, blood pressure, age, and other factors to classify patients as high or low risk for heart disease.

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple machine learning classifiers
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC
- Use the best-performing model for predicting heart disease risk

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes (optional)
